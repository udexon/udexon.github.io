## Programmer's Reference

1. In Duniix Decentralized Social Media Link #1LSD, a web page is opened with the following URL:

The word "karma" might have become a common vocabulary in the Western world due to Reddit (LOL!)

But almost 2 decades ago, Steve Balmer, then CEO of Microsoft, called Linux (and perhaps the "free software" movement that supported it) "Communism"!!

It is now "poetic karma" that GitHub, now acquired by Microsoft, provides a "back door" to break the monopolies, that are the "centralized" Internet dominated by MAGA (Microsoft Amazon Google Apple).

In order to build a "Decentralized Internet" (hence DUNIIX, or Decentralized UN`*`X), we need a way for the billions of mobile devices and web browsers around the world to connect to ___individual programmers and users' server nodes running on their mobile phones or desktop computers___. 

Some readers may find the materials in the USER's Manual too advanced for ordinary users, especially in the <a href="https://github.com/udexon/udexon.github.io/blob/main/1lsd/User_Manual.md#-users-commands-">User's Commands</a> section.

The following combination makes this possible:

1. GitHub personal website: `user.github.io`
2. `ngrok` giving away 1 free permanent connection for each GitHub user

### 2. `window.location` Hack

There have been so many layers of modules in "cloud computing" (whatever it means!!) that few people would know about the secrets to be revealed below!!

The web adress above is rather intuitive for ordinary users (we hope!!), as it only consists of:

- domain.name/service.name/?parameters
